<p>Hello,
Welcome to my website page where I will be taking you through the life I live both on campus and back at my hometown. I was born and raised in the state of Massachusetts, out of a medium sized town that contains an interesting selection of people. I am currently in the state of maine which is 210 miles from home with a travel time in a car of approximately 4 hours. </p>

<p>    After I tell people the distance I traveled to be here I either met maine people who question every reason on why I decided to come up here. So get that out of the way, I am here in Orono, Maine to pursue my fathers dream of me taking over his HVAC business back home in Massachusetts, but im here doing so because its been my dream to live my adult life up here. My dreams will always be my dreams because if I were to take over the business which I am obligated to do I will have to live around the Boston area soI can watch my business and make sure it goes smoothly through everything.</p>

<p>
